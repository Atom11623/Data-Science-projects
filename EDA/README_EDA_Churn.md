### Churn Analysis: Exploratory Data Analysis
## Introduction
This exploratory data analysis aims to uncover insights into customer churn for a utility company. The analysis encompasses historical customer data, pricing information, and a churn indicator. Understanding the underlying factors influencing churn is crucial for devising effective customer retention strategies.

## EDA Summary
Findings
Approximately 10% of customers have churned.
Consumption data is highly skewed and must be treated before modeling.
Outliers are present in the data and should be addressed before modeling.
Price sensitivity exhibits a low correlation with churn.
Feature engineering will be vital, especially for enhancing the predictive power of price sensitivity.

## Suggestions
Competitor Price Data:

Consider incorporating competitor price data. Clients may be more inclined to churn if a competitor offers a compelling deal.
Average Utilities Prices Across the Country:

Analyze average utility prices across the country. Significant deviations from the country average might influence a client's likelihood to churn.
Client Feedback:

Explore client feedback, including complaints, calls, or other interactions with PowerCo. This information may provide valuable insights into a client's propensity to churn.
Conclusion
This exploratory data analysis lays the foundation for further in-depth analysis and modeling efforts to understand and mitigate customer churn. It is recommended to explore additional data sources and perform advanced feature engineering to improve the predictive accuracy of churn models. By implementing the suggested enhancements and strategies, PowerCo can effectively enhance customer retention efforts and sustain business growth.
